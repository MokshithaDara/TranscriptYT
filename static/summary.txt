Moit and SEMA, parents of twins Sonu and Monu, observe their contrasting habits. Sonu, disciplined and diligent, wakes early to study, while Monu, carefree and procrastinating, prefers to play. Moit emphasizes the importance of time management, urging both sons to complete tasks promptly. Sonu heeds his advice, completing his studies and project, while Monu delays his responsibilities. As a result, Sonu excels in his test, while Monu receives poor grades. Moit explains to Monu that relying on luck is futile and encourages him to take ownership of his time. Monu acknowledges his father's wisdom and resolves to use his time effectively. He understands that procrastination hinders progress and that it is up to him to shape his own luck. Moit's message to his sons is to value time, prioritize responsibilities, and avoid the pitfalls of procrastination. By doing so, they can unlock their potential and achieve success.
